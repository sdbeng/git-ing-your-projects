## Hello world!
Welcome to my git-ing training!

### Intro
The purpose of this doc is to help you out with git routine tasks during your Full Stack Developer journey.

First of all, you should master the basic git commands to create repos, clone repos and push code from your computer. Then learn more advanced commands to remove non wanted files or reset recently tracked files or folders, pull rebase, etc.

I'm going to explain one way to get started(by clone a repo), probably the way your teacher suggested but feel free to create and push to repos from local, that works fine too.
